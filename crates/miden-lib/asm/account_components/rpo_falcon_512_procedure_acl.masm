#! Authenticate a transaction using the Falcon signature scheme only if specified auth trigger
#! procedures were called.
#!
#! This authentication procedure checks if any of the trigger procedures were called during the
#! transaction. If none were called, authentication is skipped. If at least one was called,
#! the standard RpoFalcon512 signature verification is performed.
#! Nonce is incremented in both cases.
