# BUILD OUTPUT VAULT
# =================================================================================================

#! Builds the output vault which is combination of the assets in the account vault at the end of the

#! - we then loop over the output notes and insert their assets into the output vault.
#!
#! Note that this does not handle anything related to the fee asset. The fee asset is removed from
#! the account vault after this procedure has executed and since it is not added to an output note,
#! we don't have to account for it explicitly.

# FEE PROCEDURES
# =================================================================================================

#! Computes the fee required for the current transaction.

#! The number of cycles a transaction will take to verify depends logarithmically on the number of
#! cycles that were proven. We estimate this by taking log2 of the estimated number of cycles the
#! transaction will take to execute, rounded up to the next power of two.
#!
#! Inputs:  []
#! Outputs: [fee_amount]

#!
#! Inputs:  [fee_amount]
#! Outputs: [FEE_ASSET]
#!

#! Computes the fee of this transaction and removes the asset from the native account's vault.
#!
#! Note that this does not have to account for the fee asset in the output vault explicitly,
#! because the fee asset is removed from the account vault after build_output_vault and because
#! it is not added to an output note. Effectively, the fee asset bypasses the asset preservation
#! check. That's okay, because the logic is entirely determined by the transaction kernel.

# TRANSACTION EPILOGUE PROCEDURE
# =================================================================================================

#! Finalizes the transaction by performing the following steps:
#! - invokes the native account's authentication procedure.
#! - computes the output notes commitment.
#! - computes the transaction's fees and takes them out of the account vault.
#! - computes the account delta commitment and the final account commitment, and the merged
#!   hash of both.
#!
#! Note that the order of operations in this procedure is important. We want to run as many
#! operations as possible before computing the fee, since the fee depends on the transaction's
#! number of cycles. All operations that run before fee computation are included when invoking
#! `clk`. The cycles of operations that run after fee computation must be calculated to include
#! them in the fee and calculating is easiest when the operations are simple.
#!
#! Inputs:  []
#! Outputs: [OUTPUT_NOTES_COMMITMENT, ACCOUNT_UPDATE_COMMITMENT, FEE_ASSET, tx_expiration_block_num]
#!
#! Where:
#! - OUTPUT_NOTES_COMMITMENT is the commitment of the output notes.
#! - ACCOUNT_UPDATE_COMMITMENT is the hash of the the final account commitment and account
#!   delta commitment.
#! - FEE_ASSET is the fungible asset used as the transaction fee.
#! - tx_expiration_block_num is the transaction expiration block number.
#!
#! Locals:
#! - 0..4: OUTPUT_NOTES_COMMITMENT
#! - 4..8: FEE_ASSET
#!
#! Panics if:
#! - the assets that were in input notes or in the account vault at the beginning of
#!   transaction execution are not in output notes or in the account vault at the end of the
#!   transaction. The exception to this is the automatically computed and removed fee asset.
#! - the transaction does not change the chain state. This must be the case to avoid tx
#!   replayability. A tx changes the chain state if it either consumes 1 or more input notes or by
#!   changing the account's state. The latter is validated as part of computing the account delta
#!   commitment.
#! - the account vault does not contain the computed fee.
